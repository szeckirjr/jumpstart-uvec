## Description

One of the main challenges for the people working on projects is to be able to start effectively. Even if people have great ideas, they often struggle to get started. Jumpstart aims to simplify the creation of projects and help manage user projects effectively. It allows the user to jumpstart a project and creates a list of steps automatically. The steps help to guide the user how they can proceed on the topic. Each project also contains a list of tasks for each of the steps.

## Bugs

1. The system can be optimized by refactoring the firebase API code to create more specific firebase calls for each project instead of
using the same firebase call for all projects.
