# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Description

One of the main challenges for the people working on projects is to be able to start effectively. Even if people have great ideas, they often struggle to get started. Jumpstart aims to simplify the creation of projects and help manage user projects effectively. It allows the user to jumpstart a project and creates a list of steps automatically. The steps help to guide the user how they can proceed on the topic. Each project also contains a list of tasks for each of the steps. 



## installation instructions

The project uses React and Firebase. 

Clone the project:

### `git clone https://github.com/szeckirjr/jumpstart-uvec.git`

Install dependencies:

### `npm install`

Run the app:

### `npm start`



## Bugs

1. The system can be optimized by refactoring the firebase API code to create more specific firebase calls for each project instead of
using the same firebase call for all projects.
